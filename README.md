# Welcome ! 🕺

Hi! I'm a versatile and curious developer who thrives at the intersection of high-level creativity and low-level technical depth. From building web applications to tinkering with systems programming, COBOL, and game modding, I love understanding how things work under the hood — then bending them to my will. Whether it's reverse engineering, optimizing legacy code, or crafting smooth user experiences, I enjoy solving problems in unconventional ways and constantly learning along the journey.

Outside of my development work, I stay active by regularly practicing sports, reading philosophy, or by working on my old cars!
